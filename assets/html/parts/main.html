    <p>I have been in private practice on the <b>San Francisco Peninsula</b> for over 25 years.  I treat a wide range of conditions, including depression, bi-polar disorder, anxiety and panic disorders, sexual abuse issues, relationship and stress-related problems.  My primary specialty is the treatment of the full-spectrum of eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating.</p>
    <div class="main-line"></div>
    <p>With my extensive background and experience, I have developed an effective alternative to traditional weight loss programs called <b>Self-Regulated Eating</b>.  This approach is for yo-yo dieters, emotional eaters, and binge eaters who are tired of going on diet after diet, only to revert back to their familiar eating habits <b>AND</b> gaining all of their weight back and maybe even more.</p>
    <div class="main-line"></div>
    <p>Dieting does not lead to long-term weight loss.  The physical consequences of dieting, metabolic suppression and incessant hunger, contribute to the subsequent weight gain, but there are psychological reasons as well.  Diets focus on changing what and how much to eat in order to lose weight.  They do not help the dieter understand and modify how and why they make their eating decisions.  <b>Self-Regulated Eating</b> addresses the psychological and emotional issues that stand in the way of truly changing lifelong eating habits.</p>

    <p><b>Dr. Bolter</b> is currently writing a book based on <b>Self-Regulated Eating</b> with her daughter <b>Dr. Nicole Bolter</b><i>, a Sport and Exercise Psychology</i> professor.  Her academic experience in coaching, motivation, self-perceptions, and self-regulation provides an excellent complement to Dr. Kay Bolterâ€™s clinical experience and expertise.  They also have a blog featuring articles on a wide range of eating topics.</p>
